# CloudDev1
This project was done during my Cloud Development course. Created a system to create, edit, delete, and get information on various boats and loads. 
Creating and deleting various boats or loads involved several criteria that introduced a variety of challenges for the project.
All our work was done within the Google Cloud Platform and all functionality was tested using Postman.
This project was a great experience for learning more about making HTTP requests, REST APIs and general practice using JavaScript
